# Data-analytics-app
A Haskell app that receives a dataset consisting of some course grades at the input and returns certain statistics about student grades such as number of students who have passed the course, average exam grade etc.

The application reads dataset from four CSV files. The first set of tasks returns some statistics about the grades and students such as: number of students who gained at least 1.5 points from homework, percentage of students who have passed the exam. The second set and the fourth set apply different opperations on the tables which store data (tables are represented as list of lists). The third set of tasks creates some new algebraic datatypes and classes for data stored in CSV files.
